            UNLESS i have some sort of contact with a boy. When we regain contact, you take hours to respond. But when we havent been talking for a while,
             you are quick to respond etc. I know why. It's because you dont actually like me, you like our memories, when we used to stay up late together.
            You like the attention and validation i give you, that i will always come back to you. </p>
